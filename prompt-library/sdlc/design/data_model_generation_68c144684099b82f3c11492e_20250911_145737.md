title: Data model Generation
weight: 28
---

Template for generating data models based on module name, target database, constraints, and architecture context.

```
## Inputs
- Module Name: {{moduleName}}
- Target Database: {{targetDatabase}}
- Constraints: {{constraints}}
- Requirements: {{Requirements}}

## Analysis Phase
1. Review the module, requirements, and context.
2. Understand the constraints that must be enforced (e.g., uniqueness, required fields, relationships).
3. Ask clarifying questions if any ambiguities arise.

## Implementation Phase
1. Design a simplified data model suitable for {{targetDatabase}}.
2. Ensure the model aligns with the overall design.
3. Produce a **Mermaid ER diagram** to visualize relationships clearly.
4. Provide the schema in a single downloadable Markdown file.
5. Adjust naming conventions where needed for clarity and consistency.

## Verification Phase
- Confirm that all constraints have been applied.
- Verify the model supports the module’s requirements.
- Highlight any assumptions or design trade-offs made.
- Ensure readability and alignment with the system’s architecture.

## Output Format
The output should include:
1. Data model schema definition
2. Mermaid diagram representation
3. Notes on assumptions or constraints
4. Downloadable Markdown file
